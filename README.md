# Dot Files
My dot files shared between machines for ZSH, Bash, macOS, and Linux.

## Status

TESTING

This is a work-in-progress, my third major refactoring of my personal dotfiles, but this time as a fork of @MikeMcQuaid's [dotfiles](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/dotfiles) so that these dotfiles may leverage @MikeMcQuaid's [strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid//strap) for initial macOS configuration with updates, brew, and installation of default dotfiles. Secondary goal is to leverage ZSH as macOS now uses that shell by default. There is of good architecture in my previous iteration at https://github.com/ChristopherA/.dotfiles based on BASH and Stow that still needs to be ported over to this version.

## Installation
Is run automatically as part of @Mike McQuaid's [strap](/MikeMcQuaid/strap)

Or [`script/setup`](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/dotfiles/blob/master/script/setup)
after checkout to symlink (or copy) everything in this directory to your home directory.
